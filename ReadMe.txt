			c. INSERT Syntax (TXT)
				This TXT file includes the INSERT Syntax for each table in

				foreign key from Table A).

			d. DELTE SYNTAX (TXT)
				This TXT file includes the DELETE Syntax for each table in 
				our database. It also include table dependencies and order
				of DELETS where required (i.e. Table A's data must be

			ReadMe with instructions on the order to enter each file's content 
			into the database.

		SQL CREATE:
